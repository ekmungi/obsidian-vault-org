# Enterprise Vault Audit

## Status: Not Yet Audited

The enterprise vault path has not been established. This file will be populated when:
1. The vault path is known
2. Initial PARA structure is created
3. Plugin configuration is decided

## Expected Structure

Should mirror the personal vault's PARA structure:
- `00 INBOX`
- `01 PROJECTS`
- `02 AREAS`
- `03 RESOURCES`
- `04 ARCHIVE`

## Enterprise-Specific Considerations

- Work-related projects and meeting notes
- Outlook calendar integration (outlook-meeting-notes plugin)
- Enterprise OneDrive sync considerations
- Potential compliance requirements for work documents
