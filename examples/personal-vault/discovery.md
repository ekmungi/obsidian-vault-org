# Personal Vault Audit

## Vault Location

`C:\Users\ekmun\OneDrive\Obsidian_Vault\Mungi_Personal`

**Note**: Path is dynamic. When on work laptop, vault may be on a different drive. OneDrive handles sync.

## PARA Folder Structure

The vault uses numbered PARA prefixes (00-04) for consistent sort order, plus an Excalidraw folder for visual diagrams.

### 00 INBOX
- 1 file

### 01 PROJECTS
Top-level: 0 files (all content in subfolders)

**Jeeves subfolder** (nested under 01 PROJECTS):
- Contains 8 subdirectories mirroring the parent structure (AI Agents, AI Meeting Notes, Brainstorming, Claude-Code Orchestration, Jeeves - Claude Session Notes, Meeting Transcription, Notes)

## File Statistics

- **Total Markdown files**: 46
- **Total .base files**: 4
- **Excalidraw scripts**: 8

## Template Inventory

**Location**: `03 RESOURCES/Templates/`
**Count**: 3 templates (minimal)

Templates are basic. Templater plugin is configured but no folder templates are set (no auto-template-on-create behavior).

## Database Inventory (.base files)

Obsidian Bases (core plugin) is used for database views:

| Database | Path |
|----------|------|
| Projects DB | `01 PROJECTS/01 Projects DB.base` |
| Job Positions DB | `01 PROJECTS/Job Search/01 Job Positions DB.base` |
| Contacts DB | `03 RESOURCES/Contacts/01 Contacts DB.base` |
| Templates DB | `03 RESOURCES/Templates/01 Templates DB.base` |

## Plugin Configuration

### Dataview
- JavaScript queries enabled
- European date format (DD.MM.YYYY)

### AI Meeting Notes
- Output folder: `03 RESOURCES/Meetings`
- Actively used for meeting transcription

### Templater
- Enabled but underutilized
- No folder templates configured (no auto-apply on file creation)
- Template folder: `03 RESOURCES/Templates`

### Smart Connections
- Enabled for semantic search
- MCP server integration (used by Jeeves obsidian-knowledge skill)
- Known issue: re-indexes frequently during active editing, which is disruptive

## Theme and Visual Setup

- **Theme**: obsidianotion
- **Style Settings**: obsidian-style-settings plugin for theme customization
- **Folder Icons**: obsidian-icon-folder with colored PARA icons
- **List Formatting**: list-style plugin for improved list rendering

## Key Observations

1. **Projects folder is messy**: Mixed project types without clear categorization. Jeeves subfolder appears to be accidental nesting that duplicates the parent structure.

2. **Minimal templates**: Only 3 templates for 46 files. Need a comprehensive template system for consistent note creation (meeting notes, project briefs, area reviews, etc.).

3. **Smart Connections re-indexing**: Disrupts workflow during active editing sessions (e.g., live meeting transcription). Needs configuration tuning.

4. **Plugin redundancy**: make-md is disabled but still installed. Should be fully removed since Bases (core) supersedes it.

5. **Emoji toolbar conflict**: obsidian-emoji-toolbar is enabled, but user preference is no emojis. Evaluate whether to remove.

6. **Empty folders**: Several empty subfolders (Obsidian Help, Wallpapers, attachments, Claude-Code Orchestration). Clean up or populate.

7. **Archive structure**: Archived projects are mostly empty folders -- likely created as placeholders when projects were "completed" but notes were never moved.

8. **No daily notes**: daily-notes.json exists in config but no daily note files found. Either unused or configured but not adopted.

9. **Templates DB**: A .base file tracks templates themselves -- unusual. Evaluate if this adds value or adds complexity.

10. **Notion migration incomplete**: 46 files is low for a migrated vault. Many Notion pages may not have been brought over yet.
